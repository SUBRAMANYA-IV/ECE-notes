# Diodes

Circuit element which **does not** follow a linear current-voltage relationship. 

## The Ideal Diode

The ideal diode has I-V charecteristics such that, when the voltage is negative
(reverse biased), it acts as an open circuit and doesnt allow any current
to flow. When the voltage is positive, the diode acts as a "short circuit"
allowing any current to flow with zero voltage drop. A **forward-biased** diode
is said to be "turned on". 

##### example use of dioes: rectifier

Diodes can be used in AC circuits to attenuate the negative portion of
sinusoidal signals that are supplied to a load.
