Lecture Notes: 01-29
=====================

- Impedence of a capacitor is given by 
  $\frac{1}{j\omega c} $

- The "time constant" or "time delay" is given by 
  
  $\tau=rc$

- *Low-Pass Filter Equation*
  
  $V_0=V_i(\frac{\frac{1}{j\omega c}}{\frac{1}{j\omega c}+R}) $



- *High-Pass Filter Equation* 
  
  $V_0=V_i(\frac{R}{\frac{1}{j\omega c}+R}) $


- _Octave: Halving or Doubling of frequency_
- _Decade: div or multiplication by a factor of 10 of frequency_




Small Scale Model 
==================

- Silicon crystals form 4 way face-centered cubic crystals
- possibly random distribution of thermal energy. Average of $V_e $
- When it exceeds $1.12 eV $, the electrns will become delocalised. 
- causes a certain region to gain a positive charge. 
- electron travels around until it finds a region with energy lower than $1.12 eV $
- *Measured in electrons per cubic centimeter* 

- Number of carrir/electron concentration is given by $n$ (for negative)
- $n=p$ for an _intrensic semiconductor_, as every electron has a complementary proton
- also given as $n_i $
- $n_i^2 $ is only temperature dependent
