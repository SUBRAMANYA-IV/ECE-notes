# Intrinsic Semiconductors

Most modern semiconducotrs use silicon, which has 4 valance electrons. This
means it can form 4 covelant bonds in a crystaline structure with other 
Silicon Atoms. 

At room temperature, sufficient thermal energy exists to break some of the 
covelant bonds, a process known as **thermal generation**. When a covelant bond
is broken, one of the electrons is "free". ***Free Electrons*** are free
to move within the lattice structure, and can conduct electric current if an
**electric field** is applied to the crystal. 

When the electron leaves its "parent" atom, it leaves behind a net positive
chage, equal to the magnitude of the electrons. This is called a **hole**; a 
positively charged ion in the crystal structure. 
This net positive charge may attract a neighboring atoms electrons, causing it
to leave its parent atom. This fills up the "hole" in the current atom, but
leaves a hole in the neighboring atom. 

This results in what is effectively a **Positive Charge Carrier**, which "moves"
through the silicon crsytal, being able to conduct electric current. 

- as room temperature increases, more covelant bonds are broken
  - as a result more electron-hole pairs are generated.
  - more charge carriers means higher conductivity. 


# Number of Free electroncs and holes in a unit volume

- **Thermal Generation** results in free electron/holes in equal numbers, and equal
**concentrations** 
- Electrons filling holes is called **recombination**
- recombination rate is propoertional to the number of free electrons and holes 
  which in turn is determined by the thermal generation rate.
- Thermal generation is strongly determined by temperature
- in **thermal equilibrium**, the recombination rate is equal to the generation 
  rate, and so the concentration of _free electrons_ $n$ is equal to the 
  concentration of holes $p$, hence 

$n=p=n_i$

where $n_i$ represents the number of free electrons or holes in a unit volume 
($cm^3$) of **intrinsic silicon** at a given temperature. 

The equation for the number of free carrier electroncs per unit volume is given 
by 

$n_i=BT^{3/2}e^{-\frac{E}{2kT}}$


Non-intrensic/doped semiconductor 
=================================

- intrinsic semicondictors have the same concentrations of free electrons and 
  holes, through thermal generation
- These concentrations are too small to use at room temperature
- Carrier concentration and Conductivity being propoertional to temperature is 
  not useful
- Solution: doped silicon. Substantially changes the carrier concentration.

adding intentional impurities to a intrensicsemiconductor makes it useable for 
a wider range of applications. Given the range of $10^{22}$ atoms of silicon, it 
is doped in the range of $10^{15}$ to $10^{18}$  

To increase the concentration of free electrons, $n$, silicon is doped with an
element with valence 5, such as phosphorus. 

##### Example: Phosphor Atom (pentavalent)
---------------------------------------------

Given a $3x3$ matrix of silicons, replacing the central atom with a phosphor atom
will result in an extra free electron, due to the extra electron.

* TODO: Include lattice picture. 

Because phosphorus has 5 valence electrons, 4 of them are covelant bonded
to the silicon and the fifth one becomes a free electron. hence, each phosphorus
atom _donates_ a free electron to the lattice structure. The phosphorus impurity
is called a _donor_. 

* **IMPORTANT**: No holes are generated in this process. The positive charge 
  associated with the phosphorus atom is a _bound charge_ that does not move
  through the lattice structure. 

Given the concentration of donor atoms is $N_D$, where $N_D$ is usually much
greater than $n_i$ (concentration of free electrons), the concentration of
free electrons in the _n-type_ silicon will be

$n_n \approx N_D$

where $n_n$ is the concentration of free electrons in an n-type silicon. 

HOWEVER, this is not the case for hole concentration. **All holes in the n-type
silicon are generated by thermal ionization.**

Using the relationship $pn=n_i^2$, we can determine

$p_nn_n=n_i^2$

substituting for $n_n$ with $N_D$ we get

$p_n\approx\frac{n_i^2}{N_D}$

Given, this, the concentration of free electrons will be much greater than
that of the holes, hence electrons are the **majority** charge carriers while
the holes are the **minority** charge carriers. 

###### brief explanation (TODO)

Because $n_i$ represents the product of free electrons to ions, 



##### *Example: Boron Atom (trivalent)*
----------------------------------------------------------

In the same situation above, but with boron, everyone boron will contribute 
1 "free hole". 

Because there more holes than electrons, this is called a *_p-type_* 
semiconductor. 


# current flow in semiconductors


## Drift Current

When an electrical field $E$ is established in a semiconductor latttice, holes
(positively charged) accelerate _in the direction_ of $E$ while free electrons
accelerate in the _opposite_ direction of E. The equations of their repsective
velocity are given by 


$v_{p-drift}=\mu_p E$

where $\mu_p$ is a constant called the **hole mobility**. It represents
the "ease" by which holes move through the lattice in response to the electrical
field. Given that $E$ and $v_{p-drift}$ are given in units of $\frac{volts}{centimeter}$
and $\frac{centimeters}{second}$, $\mu_{p}$ has units of $\frac{centimeters^2}{volt\cdot second}$.
For _intrinsic silicon_ $\mu_p=480$

$v_{n-drift}=-\mu_n E$

here $\mu_n$ is the electron mobility, which is $1350$. This demonstrates that
electrons move more easily through the silicon crystal compared to holes. 

We can calculate the current component due to holes and electrons seperately. 

Consider a plane perpendicular to the $x$ direction. In one second, the hole
charge that crosses that plane will be $Aqpv_{p-drift}$. Substituting the 
previous equation for the drift velocity, we get 

$I_p=Aqp\mu_pE$

This gives the current component due to the **drift of holes**.
The same process can be used to get the equation for current caused by
the drift of electrons, _however_ the sign is negative due to the convention of
current being the flow of _positive charges_. 

$I_n=-Aqnv_{n-drift}=-Aqn\mu_nE$

or 

$J_n=qn\mu_n E$

Adding these quantities together, we get the _total drift current density_, given by 

$J=J_p+J_n=q(p\mu_p+n\mu_n)E$

This relationship can be written as 

$J=\sigma E$

where the **conductivity** $\sigma$ is given by 

$\sigma=q(p\mu_p+n\mu_n)$


## Diffusion current. 

Occurs when the density of charge carriers in a semiconductor is not uniform. 

- a region in high concentration of holes will "diffuse" from the high concentration region to surrounding lower concentration regions
- same for electrons. 
- Results in a net flow of charge, hence **diffusion current**

the _magnitude_ of the current at any point is proportional to the _slope_ of
the concentration profile, or the **concentration gradient**, at that point. 
The current density is given by the function 

$J_p=-qD_p\frac{dp(x)}{dx}$

for the afformentioned scenario, and 

$J_n=qD_n\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$

for electrons. 

**IMPORTANT**: note the signs for each of these equations.
- for holes, a negative $\frac{dp(x)}{dx}$ function means lower concentration 
  as $x$ increases, leading to a flow of holes in the $x$ direction, hence 
  a positive current.
- for electrons, a negative $\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$ function gives the same concentration curve as above, _BUT_, electron movement in the $x$ direction means a curent moveent in the $-x$ direction. 


# PN Junctions

![PN-junction](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theengineeringprojects.com%2F2018%2F05%2Fintroduction-to-pn-junction.html&psig=AOvVaw1-xt86gtcwDRiYtDEJTHjL&ust=1707753685375000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCIjl_q_Uo4QDFQAAAAAdAAAAABBQ)

A basic, useful type of semiconductor formed by bringing a p-type and n-type
semiconductor into close contact. 

The $p-type semiconductor$ is charecterized by its majority charge carriers
being holes. **HOWEVER**, the charge of these holes are neutralized by an 
equal number of bound negative charge associated with the acceptor atoms. 

in the _n-type_ semiconductor, the majority of charge carriers are electrons. 
**HOWEVER**, the bound positive charge neutralized the charge of the majority
electrons. 

#### key note: Difference between net charge and free floating charge carriers

#### Diffusion Current $I_D$

Because of the difference in concentrations of charge carriers for both the
p and n type semiconductors, the charge carriers diffuse across the junction.
Electrons from the n side to the p side, and holes from the p side to the n side. 
Given the movement of charges, this causes a current **from** the p side **to**
the n side. 

#### Depletion Region

The holes that diffuse across the junction into the $n-region$ recombine with
some of the majority-electrons, and thus "dissapear". Same goes for the free
electrons diffusing into the $p-region$.

Given this, some of the _bound positive charge_ will no longer be neutralized
by free electrons. This net positive charge is said to be **uncovered**. Given
that recombination takes place close to the junction, this leaves a region
_depleted of free electrons_ and contains a net _uncovered_ positive charge. 

##### Steps to better understand the depletion region
1) Uneven concentration of charge carriers leads to electrons diffusing into 
   the _p-type_ region and holes into the _n-type_ region
2) movement of charge carriers leads to current in the direction of p-to-n
2) new charges in each material leads to: 
   - p-type: electrons that diffuse into the p-region recombine with 
     some of the majority-hole-carriers. Lack of majority-hole carriers leads 
     to a net-negative charge, due to the presence of bound-negative charges
   - n-type: holes that diffuse into the n-region recombine with some of the 
     majority-electron-carriers. Lack of electrons leads to a net-positive 
     charge, due to the presence of bound-positive charges. 

All of this leads to a potential barrier $V_0$ being established across the
junction, with the n-side at a positive voltage relative to the p side. 
This opposes the diffusion of carriers across the junction. 

##### Drift Current and Equilibrium

In addition to the current due to diffusion, a component due to _minority
carrier_ exists across the junction. 

This is caused by the _thermally generated holes_ in the _n material_, which
move towards the junction and reach the edge of the _depletion region_. 
There, they experience the electric field in the depletion region. 
This sweeps it into the p side. The opposite interaction occurs with electrons
in the _p material_. 
This results in a current that moves rom the _n_ side to the _p_ side. 

Given that in an open-circuit situation, no current flows, the magnitude of 
$I_D$ is equal to $I_S$. 
This relationship is maintained by the barrier voltage $V_0$, hence if for
any reason $I_D$ exceeds $I_S$, more bound charges will be uncovered
ono both ends, resulting in the depletion layer increasing until $I_D$ 
decreases until it reaches equilibrium with $I_S$ again. 
Vice versa, when $I_S$ increases, the number of uncovered charges will decrease,
the depletion layer will narrow down, and the voltage $V_0$ will decrease. 
This will cause $I_D$ to increase until equilibrium is reached. 

##### Built in Voltage

With no external voltage, the barrier voltage $V_0$ is given by

$V_0=V_tln(\frac{N_AN_D}{n_i^2})$

where $N_A$ and $N_D$ are the doping concentrations of the _p_ and _n_ side. 

#### Relationship between Diffusivity $D$ and mobility of charge carrier $\mu$


A useful relationship that relates diffusion constant with mobility is 

$\frac{D_n}{\mu_n}=\frac{D_p}{\mu_p}=V_T$

where $V_t=\frac{kT}{q}$. The parameter $V_T$ is the **thermal voltage**. 
at room temperature, $V_T$=25.9 $mV$

As the temperature increases, a larger portion of electrons gain enough
energy to cross the junction, creating a potential difference or *voltage*
across the junction. 

##### Width and Charge stored in depleted region. 

The magnitude of charge on each side of the depleted region can be given by the
following equations

For the _n_ side

$|Q_{+}|=qAx_nN_D$

and for the _p_ side


$|Q_{-}|=qAx_nN_A$

where $A$ is the **cross sectional** area of the junction, and the $x$ is
the "depth" of the depleted region. 
The charge equality condition can now be rewritten as

$qAx_nN_D=qAx_nN_A$

cancelling out like terms, the equationc an be rearanged to give

$\frac{x_n}{x_p}=\frac{N_A}{N_D}$

Furthermore, the total width of the depletion layer can be given by the equation

$W=x_n+x_p=\sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon}{q}(\frac{1}{N_A}+\frac{1}{N_D})V_0}$

where $\epsilon_0$ represents the electrical permeattivity of silicon. 

Using the previous two equations, the width of the depletion region on each side
of the junction can be given by 

$x_n=W\frac{N_A}{N_A+N_D}$

and 

$x_p=W\frac{N_D}{N_A+N_D}$


Given that in equilibrium, both sides of the depletion region holds the same
magnitude of charge, the charge stored on either side of the depletion
region in terms of $W$ as 

$Q_J=|Q_+|=|Q_-|$



## the _PN_ junction with an applied voltage

applying a _DC_ voltage to the terminals of a _PN_ semiconductor changes its
properties. 
Applying a voltage so that the _p_ side is positive than the _n_ side is called
a "forward" bias. Conversely, if a positive voltage is applied to the _n_ side,
its called a reverse-bias voltage. 


The PN junction operates under 3 conditions:

1) open circuit or "equilibrium"
1) Reverse bias, where a DC voltage $V_R$ is applied
1) the forward bias condition where a dc voltage $V_F$ is applied

in the *open circuit*, a *barrier voltage* $V_0$ is developed, making *n* more
positive than _p_, limiting the diffusion current $I_D$ to a value exactly
equal to the drift current $I_S$

![MOS-capacitor](https://images.theengineeringprojects.com/image/webp/2023/09/unbiased-pn-junction.png.webp?ssl=1)
##### Reverse Bias Case

the reverse-bias voltage $V_R$ is **in the direction** to add to the barrier
voltage, and it does, leading to an **increased** effective barrier voltage
to $V_0+V_R$
This will cause the diffusion voltage $I_D$ to approach zero, and the total
current across the junction will soley be due to the drift current $I_S$, 
casued by thermally-generated minority carriers.
Furthermore, the increase in barrier voltage will be accompanied by a 
corresponding increase in the stored uncovered charge on both sides of the
depletion region.

This can be proven by replacing $V_0$ in the previous _width expression for 
the depletion region_ with $V_0+V_R$, giving the expression. 

$W=x_n+x_p=\sqrt{\frac{2\epsilon}{q}(\frac{1}{N_A}+\frac{1}{N_D})(V_0+V_R)}$

##### Forward Bias Case

Here, the applied voltage $V_F$ is in the direction that **subtracts from
the built in voltage**, resulting in a reduced barrier voltage ($V_0-V_F$)
across the depletion region. This reduced barrier voltage will lead to 
- decreased depletion-region charge
- narrower depletion region width

This leads to more holes and electrons to diffuse across the depletion region
Thus, the diffusion current $I_D$ increases. 
The current $I$ in the external circuit is the difference between $I_D$ and 
$I_S$, given by 

$I=I_D-I_S$

and it flows from the _p_ side to the _n_ side

### Current Voltage relationship at the Junction

Assuming the application of a forward voltage $V$. **however**, this equation
will also work for reverse-bias voltage.
As previously explored, the forward bias subtracts from the built in voltage
$V_0$. The lowered barrier makes it possible for more holes and electrons
to diffuse across the junction. 
Consider the holes injected into the $n$ region. The concentration of holes in
the $n$ region at the _edge_ of the depletion region will increase significantly. 
The steady-state concentration at the edge of the depletion region will be 

$p_n(x_n)=p_{n0}e^{\frac{V}{V_T}}$

that is, the concentration of minority-holes increases from the equilibrium
value of $p_{n0}$ to a larger value determined by the value of $V$

This is described as the **excess concentration** of minority holes at $x=x_n$
due to the forward voltage, given by 

_Excess concentration_ $=p_{n0}e^{\frac{V}{V_T}}-p_{n0}=p_{n0}(e^{\frac{V}{V_T}}-1)$

As we go "deeper" into the material, more of the holes (minority charge carriers)
will recombine with the majrity electrons and dissapear. The _excess hole
concentration_ will decay exponentially the deeper you go into the material. 
As a result, the total hole concentration in the _n-type_ material can
be given by 

$p_n(x)=p_{n0}+p_{n0}(e^{\frac{V}{V_T}}-1)e^{-\frac{(x-x_n)}{L_p}}$

where $L_p$ is the constant **diffusion length** of holes n the _n_ material. 
The smaller the value of $L_p$, the faster the injected holes will recombine
with the majority electrons, resulting in a steeper decay of minority carrier
conecentration.

From the Diffusion Current section, we know a carrier-density profile is
essential for a steady-state diffusion current. 
We can determine the hole-diffusion current density by applying the equation

$J_p(x)=-qD_p\frac{dp_n(x)}{dx}$

substituting for $p_n(x)$ gives

$J_p(x)=-q\frac{D_p}{L_p}p_{n0}(e^{\frac{V}{V_T}}-1)e^{\frac{-(x-x_n)}{L_p}}$

# MOS capacitor (TODO)


**MOSFET**, or Metal Oxide Semiconductor _field effect_ transistor, is a
widespread form of semiconductor. 

In the diagram above, applying a positive voltage to the _gate_,
