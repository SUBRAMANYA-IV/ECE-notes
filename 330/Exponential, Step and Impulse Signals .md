# What are they?

1) Exponentials: Decay or growth
2) Steps- suddent changes, switches
3) impulses - perturbation, "kick the tires" 



# Continuous-Time Exponentials

Examples include equations such as 

$x(t)=Ae^{-bt}$


# Discrete-Time Exponentials

can be thought of as

$x[n]=Ae^{-bn}=A\alpha^n$

where 

$\alpha=e^{-b}$

and where $n$ is a discrete value. 


Exponentially damped sinusoids

$x(t)=Ae^{-bt}cos(\omega_0t)$


Steps
=======

$s[n]=0, n < 0$ and $s[n]=1, n\geq 0$

$s(t)=0, n < 0$ and $s(t)=1, n >0$



Impulses 
=========

$\delta[n]=0, n\neq0$ and $\delta[n]=1,n=0$
