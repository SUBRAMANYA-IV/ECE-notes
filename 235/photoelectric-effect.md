# Photoelectric Effect

Light can exite the valence electrons of certain materials, leading to them 



##### Changing the voltage
- at zero volts, there will still be some current as a few electrons could 
  make it accross the gap to the detector 
- at a positive voltage, there will be a saturation current, as the number 
  of flowing electrons is determined by the light, and the voltage only determines
  the "kinetic energy" of the electrons
- at a negative voltage, there will be a point where all electrons that are 
  exited due to the light will be pulled back towards the plate due to attractive
  force, leading to zero current. 



##### Changing the Intensity
- Expected: 
  - assuming light acts as a wave, the increase intensity (magnitude of wavelength) 
    would impart more energy to the electrons, leading to a higher kinetic energy
    leading to a shift to the left. _a leftward shift of $V_{stop}$ 
- Actual: 
    - In reality, $V_{stop}$ remains the same, while the current increases.
    - suggests that more electrons are being freed, but their individual 
      energies are still the same. Points to the idea that intensity of light
      comes from the number of "particles", and not the energy/magnitude of the 
      wave
    - $V_{stop}$ can be modified by changing the frequency of the wavelength. 

##### Changing the frequency
- Expected:
  - Number of emitted electrons depends on the the frequency: a higher 
    means more electrons emitted, because the continuous-energy model of light
    suggests that a higher frequency means energy is imparted to the electrons
    "faster", leading to more of them gaining enough energy to break free
    of the valence-shell
- Actual:
  - Frequency didnt impact the number of electrons released; it shifted 
    the stop-voltage leftward, indicating that the energy of freed electrons
    was higher; indicates that frequency effects the amount of energy 
    "imparted" to the electron; 


In short; frequency determines if the electrons are knocked out, and intensity
determines how _many_ electrons are knocked out. 

Plank points out light energy is emitted as particles called photons, given by

$E_{photon}=h\cdot f$

where $h$ represents planck's constant, $6.26*10^{-34}j\cdot s$

the work function describes how much energy is needed to free an electron
from the valence shell, given by the symbol $\phi$

This finally gives us the relationship

$eV_0=(\frac{1}{2}mv^2)_{max}=hf-\phi$

where $eV_0$ represents the electric-potential energy of the voltage between
cathode and anode, $(\frac{1}{2}mv^2)_{max}$ represents the maximum _possible_
kinetic energy of a photon, and $hf-\phi$ represents the incoming energy of a 
photon ($hf$) minus the work function $\phi$.

###### Stop Voltage vs Frequency
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To determine the stop voltage, we have to determine the kinetic energy of
the electron, which is given by 

$(hf-\phi)=E_{kinetic}$

and using conservation of energy, equating potential (electric) to kinetic gives 
us

$(hf-\phi)=eV_{stop}$

$V_{stop}=\frac{(hf-\phi)}{e}$
