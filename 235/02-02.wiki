General Equation of a Wave 
:Q
============================

The general equation of a wave can be given as: 

$\frac{\delta^2u}{\delta t^2}=v^2\frac{\delta^2u}{\delta x^2}$

where $v^2$ represents the wave velocity in the direction of propogation
and $u$ represents the vertical displacement of a given particle that lies on
the wave. 


The wave equations for the electric and magnetic field individually are
given by 

$\nabla^2\vec{E}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\delta^2E}{\delta t^2}$

$\nabla^2\vec{B}=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\delta^2B}{\delta t^2}$
