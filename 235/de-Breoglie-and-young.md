# The Wavelike properties of particles

## The de-Broglie hypothesis

De-bregolie related the frequency/wavelength of a traveling electron to 
the energy it caried with these two equations

$f=\frac{E}{h}$

$\lambda=\frac{h}{p}$

where $h$ is planks constant, and $p$ is the momentum and $\lambda$ is called the
_de broglie$ wavelength_ of the particle.  
These equations resulty directly from Einsteins quantization of radiation 
$E=hf$, and the equation for a particle of _zero rest energy_ $E=pc$ as follows

$E=pc=hf=\frac{hf}{\lambda}$

De Broglie was also able to demonstrate that these equations applied to
particles with mass (namely electrons). This lead to the physical interpretation
of _Bohr's quantization of angular momentum of the elctron in hydrogen like
atoms_, namely that the quantization is equivalent to standing wave conditions
given by

$mvr=\frac{nh}{2\pi}$

where $r$ represents the radius of the electrons orbit around the atom, an idea
more expensively covered in *Bohr's quantization of angular momentum*

Rearanging the above equation and substituting with previous equations, we get 

$2\pi r=n\lambda$

which again points to the idea that the *orbitals of an atom are quantized at
set radi* AND that *the circumference must equal an integer multiple of the
wavelength, creating a STANDING WAVE along the circumference* 

All that aside, 

### Bohr's quantization tangent
To recall from chapters that werent covered, bohr theorized that the energy
levels in an atom were quantized due to the emission spectrum showing
strict, defined lines of emission/absorption. This lead him to 
theorize that the distance between concentric energy levels in atoms were
quantized, and lead to a string of derivations/realizations such as
